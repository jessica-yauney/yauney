<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>My name is Jessica Yauney (she/her) and I'm a 2nd year (this will force me to update this at least once a year) PhD student in the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University studying Curriculum and Teacher Education (CTE) and Learning Sciences and Technology Design (LSTD) focused on Computer Science Education.</p>

    <p>I currently have research projects focused on identifying joy in computer science classrooms alongside K-12 educators (thank you to the Stanford Accelerator for funding), tracing the paths K-12 computer science educators take to begin teaching CS (Thank you Professor Park for such a great course that I don't want to stop working on the project), and developing professional learning for teacher trainers around AI use (Thank you Bosch Foundation for funding the <a href="https://www.bosch-stiftung.de/en/project/meta-maximizing-effective-teaching-ai-professional-development-and-capacity-building">META project</a>). I'm particularly interested in how affect impacts CS learning and technology usage, refinement of CS curriculum and standards, and integrating CS with other subjects.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up in Orange County, California. I did my undergrad at University of California Berkeley (class of 2015) where I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and earned my teaching credential in Secondary Mathematics. After graduating, I spent several years teaching in Los Angeles, CA at <a href="https://lennoxacademy.org/">Lennox Academy</a>. I then worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a> while earning my Master's degree from BYU in Technology. I started my PhD in 2024, where I am advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i90JgwsAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Victor R. Lee</a>.</p>
