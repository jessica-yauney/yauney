<p>This page collects my thoughts. Expect everything from short, notes–style posts from class assignments and teaching practices to concise reports on papers I’m writing. Expect rough edges and evolving ideas;. Hopefully they are at least interesting and maybe they will inspire questions, connect literatures, or distill takeaways. Posts are intentionally brief, with references when useful and occasional diagrams or code snippets. I hope these notes spark conversation about how people learn computing and how we can teach it better. Apologies in advance for posts that are off topic. Sometimes things just cause a soap box to appear under my feet.</p>
