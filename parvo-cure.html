<!-- <h2>Description:</h2>
Food webs represent the feeding relationships between organisms in an
ecosystem.  When represented as a directed graph, each organism is a vertex.
Edges connect organisms where one preys on the other.  The same
representation can be used to model the spread of a zombie contagion between
individuals in a population, where vertices represent individuals and edges
represent reported contact between the individuals.

<p>
    This document describes two forms of the same assignment.  Both versions
    have the students complete identical tasks, in one case on the organisms
    in an ecosystem, and in the other case on the individuals in a population
    facing a zombie apocalypse.
    While the tasks students completed were identical in each of the assignments
    the difference in how the assignment tasks were presented obscured this
    fact from the students.  This extended the life of the assignment by reducing
    the utility of any materials posted by students from previous semesters
    because the terms used to describe the tasks were different in the new
    context.

<p>
    The specific tasks required of the students in each version of the assignment
    were:
<ul>
    <li>Display all of the organisms and what they feed on / Display all of individuals and the individuals they have had contact with</li>
    <li>Identify the apex predators / Identify patient zeros</li>
    <li>Identify the producers / Identify potential zombies</li>
    <li>Identify the most flexible eaters / Identify the individual that has been in contact with the most individuals</li>
    <li>Identify the tastiest organism / Identify the most contacted person</li>
    <li>Determine the height of each organism in the food web / Determine the maximum distance from a potential zombie for each individual</li>
    <li>Identify the carnivores, herbivores and omnivores (bonus) / Identify spreader, regular and predator zombies (bonus)</li>
</ul>

In addition, the Zombie version of the assignment asked students to identify
individuals that were neither patient zeros nor potential zombies.  The
corresponding task (identifying organisms that are neither apex predators nor
producers) was not included in the food web version of the assignment but
could easily be added.

<p>
    The food web version of this assignment has been used with approximately
    2,000 students enrolled in a CS1 course (for non-CS majors) in at least 8
    terms.  The actual student handout from the most recent offering in the
    fall 2018 term is available in
    both <a href="FoodWebHandout.pdf">PDF</a> and <a
        href="FoodWebHandout.docx">Word</a> format.  The infectious disease version
    of this assignment has been used with approximately 350 students enrolled in
    the same CS1 course in a single term.  That version of the handout is also
    available in <a href="ZombieHandout.pdf">PDF</a> and <a
        href="ZombieHandout.docx">Word</a> formats.

    <tr><td>Summary</td>
        <td>
            This assignment asks students to create a program which analyzes
            food web data, or equivalently, asks students to analyze
            contacts between infected individuals.  In either case the
            individual parts of the assignment ask students to identify
            organisms or individuals with particular properties such as being
            a producer or being a patient zero.

        <td>
            Each variation of this assignment was the final assignment in a
            programming
            intensive CS1 course (for non-majors) that takes an objects-late
            approach.  It can be used whenever students are being introduced to
            file I/O and exceptions, and have previous experience with
            dictionaries, lists, strings and functions.  The food web version of
            the assignment was specifically crafted to appeal to non-majors by
            showing them how introductory programming could help them build tools
            to analyze data in their academic discipline of interest.
            The contact tracing version of the assignment was of particular
            relevance to all students because it was used during the COVID-19
            pandemic.

        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Difficulty</td>
        <td>
            Students found this assignment to be moderately difficult.  The
            flexibility to tackle all but the first portion of the assignment in
            any order reduced the difficulty of the assignment because students
            could, if necessary, abandon one part of the assignment and tackle
            another while waiting for an opportunity to seek help.  We gave the
            students between 2 and 3 weeks to complete the assignment and our
            impression was that this was appropriate.

        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Topics</td>
        <td>
            The assignment focuses on lists and dictionaries, and to a lesser
            extent, file I/O, exceptions, strings and functions.  Students also
            need to write loops and if statements which we assume they are
            comfortable with from prior assignments that focused on such.


        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Strengths</td>
        <td>
            Having two different versions of the assignment that appear to be
            unique but actually require students to solve the same problems with
            different "window dressing" extended the life of the assignment and
            allowed the effort put into creating grading schemes to be amortized
            over more offerings of the course.  Additional ways of presenting
            this same series of tasks are included in the Variants section.

            <p>
                The data analysis performed is non-numeric and demonstrates the
                utility of computer science to non-majors for solving problems that
                might not fit their preconceptions about the kinds of problems that
                computers are able to solve.

            <p>
                The data being analyzed in the food web assignment is real data
                from another discipline that does not have to be simplified or
                arbitrarily restricted.

            <p>
                Students are able to see that they are making progress, with each
                part of the assignment performing an additional analysis and
                immediately displaying an additional result.  It is
                <strong>not</strong> an assignment where you don't really see much
                progress until the final piece is put into place allowing everything
                to work together.  We believe that being able to see their progress
                as each part of the assignment is completed benefits students by
                providing a more immediate sense of accomplishment.

        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Weaknesses</td>
        <td>
            We have frequently noticed that students confuse returning a value
            from a function and printing a value within a function.  While
            the Zombie version of the assignment required students to
            identify the individuals inside the function body and
            then print them in the main program we noticed that numerous
            students erroneously printed the result inside the function.
            The food web version of the assignment did not include any
            requirements related to the location where results were printed,
            and as such, also didn't help students understand the difference
            between printing a result and returning it from a function.

        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dependencies</td>
        <td>
            We provided students with a function that formatted lists, which is
            available in <a href="formatList.py">formatList.py</a>, to slightly
            reduce the difficulty of the assignment.

            <p>
                Our students created their solutions in Python.  However this
                assignment could easily be adapted to Java (or very likely any other
                language used to teach CS1).


        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Variants</td>
        <td>
            This document includes two variations of the assignment, one of which
            describes the tasks students need to perform as operations on food
            webs, and another which describes the same tasks as operations
            on contact tracing data for an infection that turns people into
            zombies.  One could imagine other presentations of the same problem,
            such as analyzing friend relationships in a social network, the
            relationship between computers and routers that make up a computer
            network, or even who tagged whom in a game of tag between children.

            <p>
                Our students were asked to acquire the input file name from the
                command line and to perform some minimal exception handling.  These
                requirements could easily be removed so that this assignment could be
                used in courses that don't cover those topics.

            <p> The difficulty of the assignment could be increased by requiring
                students to handle errors in the data files such as blank or
                incorrectly formatted lines.  Students could also be asked to write
                the function that we provided for formatting lists nicely instead of
                having it provided to them.

            <p>
                Our handouts specifically told students to use lists
                to store the collections of organisms or indivudals identified
                in each part of the assignment.  The assignment could be modified
                to use sets instead of lists, or leave this choice to the students.
                Similarly, we provided an iterative algorithm for finding the
                heights of the organisms.  Students could, instead, be provided with
                a recursive algorithm, or be left to develop their own algorithm.

        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Teaching Notes</td>
        <td>
            While not included in the assignment handouts, one of the instructors
            found it particularly helpful to communicate the requirements to
            students in a visual manner when introducing the assigment in class.
            This involved drawing one of the data sets as a directed graph and
            then circling the sub-groups that needed to be identified for each
            part of the assignment.  Presenting the data visually also allowed
            the instructor to hint at data structures like trees, forests and
            graphs that students will encounter in later computer science
            courses.
